    <h2>Ingerdients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound flank steak</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>1/4 cup canola oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons fresh ginger , minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic , minced</li>
        <li>1/3 cup lite soy sauce , low sodium</li>
        <li>1/3 cup water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>4 stalks scallions , green parts only, cut into 2 inch pieces</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice the flank steak against the grain (the grain is the length of the steak) the long way ¼ inch think pieces and add it to a ziploc bag with the cornstarch.</li>
        <li>Press the steak around in the bag making sure each piece is fully coated with cornstarch and leave it to sit.</li>
        <li>Add the canola oil to a large frying pan and heat on medium high heat.        </li>
        <li>Add the steak, shaking off any excess corn starch, to the pan in a single layer and cook on each side for 1 minute.        </li>
        <li>If you need to cook the steak in batches because your pan isn't big enough do that rather than crowding the pan, you want to get a good sear on the steak and if you crowd the pan your steak with steam instead of sear.        </li>
        <li>When the steak is done cooking remove it from the pan.        </li>
        <li>Add the ginger and garlic to the pan and sauté for 10-15 seconds.        </li>
        <li>Add the soy sauce, water and dark brown sugar to the pan and let it come to a boil.        </li>
        <li>Add the green onions, stir to combine everything, and cook for a final 20-30 seconds.        </li>
        <li>Serve immediately. </li>
    </ol>
